I’m Mao Li, a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Michigan specializing in Survey and Data Science and Scientific Computing. My research focuses on leveraging Large Language Models to analyze social media data, uncovering insights into public opinion and social trends. I’m passionate about applying computational methods to enhance traditional survey data, contributing to interdisciplinary projects spanning computer science, public health, and social science.

Fun Fact: The icon for this page—and even my GitHub profile image—is a unique, AI-generated version of my dog, Duke. He’s my trusty companion and the unofficial mascot of my work!
